## User Experience (UX)


### Project Goals
ApplyWise was designed to streamline job application management, empowering users to efficiently track and organize job applications within a single platform. The application aims to provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience that simplifies the job search process for individuals and enhances their ability to manage and monitor progress effectively.

### Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was employed to effectively prioritize and organize tasks, structure user stories, and manage the project workflow using GitHub Project Boards. To streamline the creation of user stories and define epics, a custom template was developed, enabling consistency and clarity across all project planning efforts.
* Epics were written containing possible user stories and based on that the website was made.
* User stories were created by looking at epics and through iterations the project was advancing.
* Project Board is set to public.
* Project Board was used to track progression of the task through the Todo, In progress and Done columns
