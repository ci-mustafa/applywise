## Responsiveness Testing
To ensure responsiveness and adaptability, the deployed website was thoroughly tested across a range of devices and screen sizes. Developer Tools were used to simulate various screen dimensions, allowing for an in-depth review of the websiteâ€™s performance on different devices. Bootstrap classes and media queries were applied strategically to preserve both the design and functionality, guaranteeing a consistent and user-friendly experience on all platforms. This approach ensures that the website remains visually appealing and fully operational, regardless of the device used.
